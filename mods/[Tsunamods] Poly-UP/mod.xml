 Version 3.1
- preview pics added to config menu for main characters
- Fixed texture issue with UNIFORMED Quistis. No more PUMPKIN QUEEN
- Fixed MORE eyes on many characters
- fixed a few of textures sized wrong
  
Version 3.0: 
- Low Poly textures removed, new mod made for those called Flame Rebirth Plus.
- Eye fix 2.0 is here! random artifacts from eyes has been fixed
- Many textures have been replaced. The textures where a mix of both Mago and Devina edits, replaced all Devina textures to MAGO ones to make everything uniform and the same
- Confuration of mod has been updated and now you can select each individual character to active. 
    ~ Having more than 2 active at a time can and will cause crashes in scenes where more than 3 playable characters appear on screen at the same time.
      
Version 2.5:
- The eye bug has been squashed (many thanks to slimebucket for that)
- Rinoa white dress has a new face hopefully will not scare as many people. 

WARNING - HighPoly Mode WILL CRASH THE GAME on any scene that has more then 3 high poly characters on it.
